# NMAP LAUNCHER

Launch multiple port scans on multiple IP ranges one after another
Script also allows to launch scans in threads from multiple IP and
MAC source addresses for smaller network footprint.

## Purpose

We needed to launch scans for open ports on multiple IP ranges without
multithreading. To do so we first scanned most common ports on every IP range
and then increased the ports list.

Now the project has evolved to add multiple source addresses for scans to
prevent network detection when performing Red Teaming for example.
