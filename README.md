# NMAP LAUNCHER

Launch multiple port scans on multiple IP ranges one after another

## Purpose

We needed to launch scans for open ports on multiple IP ranges without
multithreading. To do so we first scanned most common ports on every IP range
and then increased the ports list.

## Help

```
usage: nmap_launcher.py [-h] [-i FILENAME] [-p FILENAME] [-n NUMBER]
                        [-d DELAY] [-v] [-f STRING] [-o DIRECTORY]
                        {oX,oN,oG,oA,oS} ...
